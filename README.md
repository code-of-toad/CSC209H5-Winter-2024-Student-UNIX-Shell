# CSC209H5-Winter-2024-Student-UNIX-Shell
The program file is named `Project-Student-Bash-Shell/tsh.c`

This project from CSC258, Fall 2024, showcases my ability to write robust C systems code for UNIX.

In particular:

* Unix System Programming – Process management, job control, and signal handling.
* Concurrency & Synchronization – Handling multiple processes and signals correctly.
* Shell Scripting & Parsing – Command-line input parsing, background/foreground job execution.
* Process Control – Forking, process groups, job management (SIGCHLD, SIGINT, SIGTSTP).
* Error Handling & Robustness – Ensuring correct execution flow and handling errors gracefully.
* I/O Redirection & Piping – Implementing file redirection (<, >) and pipes (|).
* C Programming – Pointer manipulation, memory management, and struct-based job management.
* Debugging & System Calls – Using waitpid, execve, kill, sigaction, etc.
